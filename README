ansi-colors
===========

Description
-----------

When you see colors in a terminal, they occur because of an ANSI escape
sequence, such as `\e[32m`. The most annoying part of using them, in my
opinion, is remembering what numbers do what. Therefore, I made this program.
It shows a range of numbers, with each number formatted as itself. For example,
32 corresponds to green text, so 32 appears green.

To clear colors, use `\e[m`

Note: The escape sequence can start with whatever corresponds to the escape
character. For example, I normally `\e` or `\033`, but in Lua I use `\027`.

Colors aren't the only things escape sequences can do in terminals, so read
more if you are interested.

Not all terminals are created equal. They may interpret things differently, and
some terminals might not support escape sequences at all. There's nothing I can
do about that.

Installation
------------

Local install:

`make`

System install:

`sudo make install`

System uninstall:

`sudo make uninstall`

Usage
-----

Simply type `ansi-colors` at your command line. To control the range of output:

- `ansi-colors n`:   Print numbers ranging from `0` to `n`
- `ansi-colors m n`: Print numbers ranging from `m` to `n`

Where `n` and `m` are integers.

Notes
-----

This is programmed with Linux in mind; I make no guarantees about any other OS.
